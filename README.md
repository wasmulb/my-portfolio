# Levi's Portfolio

## Description

For the second assignment, I built a portfolio for myself. The purpose of this website is so potential employers have a website to see my hard work throughout the Bootcamp.  The site contains three main sections: the about me section, the work section, and the contact-me section. In the about me section, I included a brief overview of my past professional accomplishments. Also included is a photo of myself. 

The work section is where I will show off all my projects. Since I do not have any big projects under my belt yet, I have placeholders where I will add my projects once I am further along in the course. I did include the pre-work project in this section to showcase how it will work.

The contact section is simple, but it gives potential employers a direct means to contact me after viewing the rest of my site.

The site looks best on a desktop computer in my opinion, but I included features to allow it to be viewed on mobile and tablet platforms. This allows my site to be accessible to all.

My biggest takeaway and lesson learned from this assignment is the importance of including mobile and tablet experiences from the beginning. I waited until the site was nearly finished to start adding in these features and ended up needing to change a lot. Incorporating these features from the beginning will allow me to give them more attention.

## Features

This webpage has minimal features included. It contains a navigation bar that will bring the user to desired locations on the page. It also contains links to my Github account and Linkedin (does not take the user to my Linkedin page yet since I do not have an updated page, but I will link my own page once it has been updated).
